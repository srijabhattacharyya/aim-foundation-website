                      SightHope is a transformative eye health initiative by AIM Foundation, launched to address the widespread but often overlooked burden of <strong>avoidable vision loss</strong> among underserved populations. In partnership with some of Kolkataâ€™s most renowned eye hospitalsâ€”including Sushrut Eye Foundation, B. B. Eye Foundation, and the Hope Foundationâ€”SightHope <strong>brings high-quality, no-cost eye care</strong> to those who need it most but can least afford it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For many individuals living in urban slums, rural villages, and remote areas, poor eyesight is not just a health issueâ€”itâ€™s a barrier to education, employment, mobility, and dignity. Children struggle in school, adults lose livelihoods, and elders face isolation, all due to conditions that are often preventable or easily treatable, such as refractive errors or cataracts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      SightHope steps in to fill this critical gap by organizing regular eye care camps that provide:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                      <li><strong>Comprehensive vision screenings</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Diagnosis and treatment of common eye conditions</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Prescription and distribution of corrective lenses</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Minor procedures for infections and irritations</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Free cataract surgeries for eligible individuals</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Referrals to partner hospitals for specialized care</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Each camp is conducted by qualified ophthalmologists and healthcare staff from our partner hospitals, ensuring trusted expertise and continuity of care. Camps are held at accessible community hubs, including schools, health centres, and even temporary rural setupsâ€”bringing care directly to the doorstep of marginalized communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By restoring sight, SightHope restores much more:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
                      <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>The freedom to move confidently</strong></li>
                      <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>The ability to work and earn</strong></li>
                      <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>The joy of seeing loved ones clearly again</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Above all, it restores hopeâ€”a renewed sense of possibility for people who had long accepted poor vision as their fate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Through this powerful collaboration between community outreach and medical excellence, SightHope is not just changing livesâ€”itâ€™s helping people see a better future.
